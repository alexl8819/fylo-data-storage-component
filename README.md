### What I learned

I learned more about CSS animations.

### Continued development

I focused on trying to adhere to design while adding small animations in CSS. I used CSS for animating a mock loading skeleton placeholder, while for the storage usage bar I opted to use js to animate the actual bar. In the future I my aim is to use only CSS whenever possible.
